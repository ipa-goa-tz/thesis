\section{Conclusions and Outlook}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this paper we presented a comprehensive framework for the detection and identification of people. The software utilizes a couple of novel and state-of-the-art methods and achieves compelling results for face detection as well as for face recognition tasks. Even under heavy conditions like varying lighting the system could consistently obtain recognition rates over 90\%. The robustness against head pose and facial expressions on standard database tests as well as in real life operation was convincing. The recognition system's computational demands are low enough for the application on mobile service robots. The availability of the whole software as free and open-source is intented to help other developers to faster implement complex robotics applications that depend on user.

%- wrap up the main outcomes of the paper

Future work aims at the implementation of automatic capturing of additional training images of known persons during operation in situations when the current configuration fails or has a small margin to other identifications. Furthermore, the integration of whole body detection and tracking for person detection is planned to enable model-based tracking beyond the current face or head tracking. Finally, we envisage to analyze the potential additional benefits of using the depth images also for identification as proposed in \cite{Tsalakanidou03}.
